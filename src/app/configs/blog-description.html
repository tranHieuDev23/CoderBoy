<h2>A few words about myself</h2>
<p>Greeting. My name is Trần Minh Hiếu, creator of the blog&nbsp;<strong>CoderBoy</strong>. Currently a second-year student majoring in Computer Science, at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>I was without things to do, so I made a blog.</p>
<p>To start writing a blog is freaking easy. Free blogging platforms are abundant on the internet, I myself did write a lot on both WordPress and Tumblr. The service there is wonderful - free beautiful themes, not having to bother about hosting or SEO, even responsive editor on mobile devices, you name it.</p>

<p>So why make my own blog? Because I want to create something of my own, something that has my sense of individuality on it. It is also the reason I write this blog in English instead of Vietnamese - my mother tongue. A foreign language is like a mask, blocking most people out, but leave ones with real curiosity and care to freely navigate. In a way, it makes me feel freer to express my feeling than in the language everyone can barge in and judge.</p>

<p>On this blog, I will mostly write about my personal life - the joys, the sorrows, and the path to find my place in the world. If you want to contribute, feel free to contact me.</p>
